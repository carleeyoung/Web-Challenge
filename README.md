# [Weather Vs Latitude Correlation Analysis](https://carleeyoung.github.io/Web-Challenge/)

Have you ever wondered about what factors cause the weather to change around the world?  
As you travel north or south of the equator, you will notice changes in climate.  what 
weather factors change as you get further from or closer to the equator?  
Weather data was collected from more than 500 cities generated from randomly selected latitude and
longitude coordinates. Relationships between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed were
analyzed. From these results, the list was restricted by pre-determined "ideal" weather conitions. From the
reduced data set of cities with ideal weather conditions, the nearest hotels were found and mapped.
